 				<h2>About IOL</h2>
				<p>
				The International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) is one of 12 International Science Olympiads and has been held annually since 2003. <br />Each year, teams of bright young students from around the world gather and test their minds against the world's toughest puzzles in language and Linguistics.<br />				
				<br />No prior knowledge of Linguistics or languages is required to solve the puzzles. <br />Even the hardest problems require only logical reasoning, patient work and out-of-the-box thinking.<br />
				For more information about the IOL - 2016 , visit  <a href="http://iol14.plo-in.org/" target="blank">iol14.plo-in.org</a><br /><br />India first competed in the IOL in 2009. Over the years, we have bagged 3 Silver and 4 Bronze Medals, 4 Best Solution Awards and 3 Honourable Mentions at the IOL.<br />
				Team India is chosen through the Panini Linguistics Olympiad (PLO).
