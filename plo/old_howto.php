 			<h2>How To Participate</h2>
 				<p>
 					PLO 2016 will be conducted in two rounds. Round 1 or the open round will be held on 9th January 2016 across various cities in India. The top ranking candidates of Round 1 will then be invited to participate in Round 2, which is a weeklong residential orientation-cum-selection camp to be held in May or June 2016. The top 8 candidates from round 2 will represent India in the <a href="http://iol14.plo-in.org/" target="blank">14th International Linguistics Olympiad</a> to be held from 25th to 29th July 2016 in Mysore, India.

 					<h2>Details of PLO 2016 Round 1</h2>
 					<br />
 					<p>
 					<b>Date:</b> 9th Jan 2016 (Saturday)<br /><br />
 					<b>Time:</b> 10:00 - 14:00 (4 hours)<br /><br />
 					<b>Centres:</b> The test will be held in the following Indian cities:<br /><br />
 						<i>Agartala, Bengaluru, Chennai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Kolkata, Kota, Mumbai, New Delhi, Patna, Pune</i><br />
 						<br />While filling up the registration form, you have to indicate which city you would like to take the test from. In case we do not have a centre in the city or town of your choice, you can indicate it during filling up the registration form, or contact us directly. We will try to coordinate with your school to set up a centre in your city (if your school wants to).  Address of the test centre will be emailed to you after you complete the registration process.
 						<br /><br />
 					<b>Categories:</b> PLO Round 1 happens in two categories:<br />
 						<b><br />
 							- Junior:</b> Students currently studying in class 9 or 10 are eligible for the PLO junior contest. Exceptional students studying in class 6, 7 or 8 might also write the test, but we believe that the problems are suitable for students studying in class 9 and beyond. See eligibility criteria.
 							<br /><br />
 							<b>- Senior:</b> Students currently studying in class 11 or 12 are eligible for the PLO senior contest.See eligibility criteria.
 							<br /><br />
 							While filling the registration form, make sure to choose the category you are eligible for. Based on the round 1 scores, the top 5 to 10 candidates from the Junior category and 15 to 20 candidates from the senior category will be invited for the camp and round 2, which will be held in May or June 2016.

 					<h2>Contest Format:</h2>
 					<p>
 					<br />
 					- Round 1 is a written test. There will be 5 to 6 problems, all of which needs to be answered. Each problem will have certain objective questions, though 50% of the marks are reserved for the explanations of the solutions, irrespective of whether it is explicitly asked for. Check the problems from the <a href="resources.php#past" target="blank">past contests</a> for an idea about the problems.
 					<br /><br />
 					- There might be significant or complete overlap between the problems in the senior and junior categories of the contest. However, the grading scheme and the points for the same problem can be very different for the two categories.
 					<br /><br />
 					- The objective answers will be evaluated first; the explanations will be evaluated only for a subset of the contestants who clear a cut-off score (to be dynamically decided for each category based on the score distribution). The final rank list will be decided based on the sum of the scores of the objective part and explanations. 
 					<br /><br />
 					- <i>English</i> is the default working language for the contest. This means the questions and your answers should be in English. In case you want to take the test in some other Indian language, you can indicate this while filling up the registration form. If we have more than 5 requests for a particular Indian language, we will try our best to allow the concerned candidates to take the test in that language.

 			<h2>Registration Procedure: </h2><br />
 			<p>
 				In order to take part in the contest, you MUST <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/UwwGWmTsuc" target="blank">register online</a> and pay the registration fee ( Details given below ). There is no dependency between the two processes (i.e., you might register first and then pay or vice-versa), but keep in mind that the fee amount depends on the date by which you fill up the online form. Thus, if you pay Rs. 150/- as registration fee on 10th Dec, but do not fill up the registration form by 15th Dec, then you must pay the remaining Rs. 150/- (because you are no longer eligible for the early bird discount).
 				<br /><br />
 				Once you complete both the processes, you will receive an email from us that you 

have now successfully registered for the contest. The email will also mention your 

test centre and working language.
				<br /><br />

				<b>Identity or Admit Card: </b><br /><br />
				In order to enter the test centre and write the test, you will need an id card that has 

your photograph, your and your school's name, and the class you study in (or 

alternatively date of birth). If your school id card has all these information, that 

should serve as a valid admit card for the test.<br /><br />
If you do not have any such document, then download the admit card form here ( <a href="Documents/admitcard.docx" target="blank">doc</a> or 
<a href="Documents/admitcard.pdf" target="blank">pdf</a> ) , fill it up, affix your coloured passport size photo, 

and get the photo attested by the principal of your school.<br /><br />
Note that your name and school's name on the admit card should match with what 

you have entered during registration.
				<br /><br />

				<b>Payment Procedure: </b><br /><br />
				You should first pay the appropriate registration fee through bank transfer (we will 

not be able to accept any other mode of payment this year), note down the 

transaction number, and then fill up the following form <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/puaWTYQRmr" target="blank">payment-form</a>. 

Please note that <b>your registration is not complete unless you fill this form 

correctly. Your name, email address should match exactly to what you have 

entered in the registration form.</b><br /><br />

				*Walk-in: In case you did not pay the registration fee by 1st Jan 2016 or did not register online, we would not be able to provide you an admit card. However, in every centre, we will have provision for some extra candidates. The allotment of these seats will be on first-come-first-served basis. In such cases, you have to immediately complete all the registration formalities. Your answer script will be considered for evaluation ONLY if the registration formalities are completed by 15th Jan 2016.
