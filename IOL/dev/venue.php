					<h2>About India</h2>
					<p>India is a country in South Asia bound by three water bodies in the
						South (the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean), 
						and the majestic Himalayas in the North. India is a land of incredible 
						diversity — home to many cultures, religions, cuisines and, most importantly, 
						languages.<br><br>

						The name India is derived from “Indus”, the name of the river on whose banks the
						Indus Valley civilization flourished. It is one of the oldest known human civilizations,
						dating back to 3000 BCE. As of today, most of their seals remain undeciphered, posing an 
						exciting challenge to linguists of this century. 
						In fact, India has a rich history in the study of Linguistics as well. One of the first 
						formal documentations of grammar was composed by Pāṇini in his book, Aṣṭādhyāyī. Written in
						the 4th century BCE, the work outlines around 4,000 rules of Sanskrit morphology, syntax and 
						semantics.

					<p>Even in ancient times, India was well known for it’s spicy food (or more precisely - its multitude of spices). 
						Travelers from across the world would come to India in search of spices and condiments, including cinnamon, pepper, and turmeric (all native to southern India). 
						These adventurous traders and pilgrims travelled along the Silk Route, an ancient trade network that connected Europe and Asia. Along with enjoying spices,
						the ancient Indians apparently had a sweet tooth too, as they began working on methods to refine and crystallize sugar cane juice. 
						Their efforts paid off in the 4th century CE, 
						when the first documented sugar in history was produced in India.

							<p> Four religions — Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism — originated in India, while Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam arrived in the 1st millennium CE, 
								also shaping India's diverse culture. The Mughals, in particular, played an important role in introducing elements of Islamic culture to the Indian subcontinent.
								The Mughal Empire was established in India with the victory of Babur over Ibrahim Lodhi in 1526.
								A major Mughal contribution to the Indian subcontinent was their unique architecture. Of the several monuments built during the reign of the Mughals, perhaps best known is the Taj Mahal,
								a stunning white facade constructed by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife. 
								The Mughals also brought with them an eclectic artistic tradition and the Urdu language to add to India’s already vibrant mix of art forms and languages

								<p>India’s diversity transcends the human constructs of art forms, cuisines, languages, 
									and religions. An astounding variety of landforms can be found here - be it the majestic, 
									snow-capped Himalayas, the scorching sandy deserts of Rajasthan,
									lush evergreen forests dotting north-eastern India,
									or the white-sand beaches with shimmering blue waters along the peninsular
									coast, India has them all. Such a wide range of habitats have helped make 
									India one of the world’s most biodiverse regions. The stately peacock with its resplendent tail is 
									the national bird of India,while the dignified Royal Bengal Tiger is the national animal.
									<br /><br />Complementing the naturally vibrant scenery are the people - their art, 
									dance and music. The graceful Bharatanatyam dancers from South India, the marvellous 
									traditional art forms from central India and the hauntingly
									soulful Sufi music are only some of India’s staggering folk arts.

							<p>Mysore (recently renamed Mysuru), is the third-largest city in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
								It served as the capital of the Mysore Princely Kingdom for nearly six hundred years, until 1947 when the capital was shifted to the nearby metropolis of Bangalore. 
								Mysore is unique in having retained its royal family, 
								and the Wodeyar family has resided in the palaces of Mysore for many centuries now.

							<p>The Wodeyar Kings being great patrons of art and culture, the city flourished, with its dazzling displays
										of palaces, parks, fountains and hills. It is no wonder then that Mysore has earned the sobriquet of Cultural Capital of South India. 
										Mysore has also produced some of the greatest authors in the country, particularly in the field of Kannada literature 
										(Kannada being the official language of the state).<br><br>
										Usually a quiet and calm city, Mysore springs to life during the Dasara festival for ten days in September-October. While the palaces
										remain lit throughout the ten days, the massive festivities occur on the ninth and tenth days; the royal sword and the Goddess Chamundeshwari are paraded in a procession of elephants, 
										camels and horses, accompanied by drums, music bands and dance groups in riotous colours.
