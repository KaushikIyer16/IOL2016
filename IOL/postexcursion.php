					Built in the early 1900s, the palace marvelously blends Hindu, Muslim, Rajput, and Gothic architectural 
					styles. The three-story stone building of fine gray granite with deep pink marble domes has a facade with 
					several expansive arches and two smaller ones flanking the central arch, which is supported by tall pillars.

					an intriguing collection of 700-plus weapons.There are also several temples inside the palace building. 
					The Maharajas of Mysore were devotees of Goddess Chamundi, which is why the palace faces the Chamundi Hills.
