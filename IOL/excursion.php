						After breakfast at the Olympiad venue, we depart to <i>Somanathapura</i> (43 km) and visit the <i>Chennakesava</i> Temple.
						Our visit will have ample time to explore the temple complex and embrace the rich history of the area.
						We then move to a resort nearby for a meal in traditional Karnataka style. 
						<br />
						Post lunch, we head to the <i>Shivanasamudra</i> waterfalls (43 km).  
						After visiting both branches of the falls, <i>Ganganachukki</i> and <i>Bharachukki</i>, 
						we return to the Olympiad venue (85 km) in time for dinner.

								Somanathapura houses the famous Chennakesava Temple which was built nearly 750 years ago.
								The temple is one of the finest examples of architecture from the Hoysala empire (11th-14th 
								century in the state of Karnataka). <br /><br />
								Its star-shaped symmetrical architecture, fine sculptures 
								on equally prominent shrines, and panel sculptures form a cloister that
								speak of good taste. The temple is made entirely out of soapstone, and its walls and ceilings 
								are adorned with intricate carvings	typical of the Hoysala era.

								<p>
								The sculptures are both of deities, 
								as well as depictions of affluence of that age including members of	the royal family riding richly 
								decorated chariots, soldiers and commoners riding horses, camel drawn vehicles, dancers, musicians, 
								hunters armed with bows and arrows.<br /><br />
								The friezes on its outer walls with carved rows of caparisoned 
								elephants, charging horsemen, and mythological birds and beasts are spellbinding. The overall effect 
								of the decorated towers, wall images and sculptures is well-balanced.

								The beautiful Shivanasamudra waterfalls that arise from the Kaveri River have two branches, 
								Ganganachukki and Bharachukki. Asia's first hydro-electric power station is also located at
								the waterfalls. 
								<br />
								Gaganachukki is a huge horsetail waterfall and the tranquil Bharachukki is a 
								jagged roaring cascading waterfall. There is plenty of space to relax at the Bharachukki 
								falls â€“ visitors can take a dip in the river or enjoy a coracle boat ride to reach the mouth 
								of the massive waterfall. The area is surrounded by forested hills and lush green valleys, and 
								is a paradise for nature lovers.
